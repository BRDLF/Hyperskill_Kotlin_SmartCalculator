# Hyperskill_Kotlin_SmartCalculator

This was the 6th project I am completing as part of Jetbrain Academy's "Kotlin Basics" course

It is rated as a challenging difficulty project. The goal is to make a calculator that does all kinds of calculations!

### Stage 1/8: 2+2

The first stage of the course had lots of lessons listed as prerequisites in order to complete the first stage. From "Kotlin basics" like var declaration and working with strings to things like logging, memory allocation and self-documenting code.

The task of the first stage is to take an input of 2 integers on a single line, and print their sum.
That's a pretty straightforward task! So, I decided to plan ahead, make the calculator singleton and add error handling.... just in case.

It's probably "too much code" for right now, but it might save me pain in the future, who knows.

I have also included the tests that Hyperskill uses to determine if a project is complete.
