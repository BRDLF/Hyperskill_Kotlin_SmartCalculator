# Hyperskill_Kotlin_SmartCalculator

This was the 6th project I am completing as part of Jetbrain Academy's "Kotlin Basics" course

It is rated as a challenging difficulty project. The goal is to make a calculator that does all kinds of calculations!

I have also included the tests that Hyperskill uses to determine if a project is complete.
